# Sudoku Validator in Ruby
---
It was a random idea I had after finding out about [LeetCode - Problem 36](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/)

According to my tests it has O(n) time complexity and ~~O(1) space complexity~~ by using bitmasks instead of several arrays to check for repeated numbers.

*Am I the first one to find that algorithm?*
